# Welcome to Spark Dev!

1. To help us improve Spark Dev, we anonymously track usage metrics. See the
   [spark/metrics](https://github.com/particle-iot/metrics) package for details on what
   information is tracked and for instructions on how to disable it.

2. If you only remember one thing make it `ctrl-shift-P`. This keystroke toggles
   the command palette, which lists every Spark Dev command. Yes, you can try it now!
   Press `ctrl-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. It will trigger the
   `markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.

3. Here is where you can get more help with Atom

   * The [Spark Dev docs](http://docs.spark.io/dev/) contains help with common tasks
     like compiling and flashing devices.
   * Discuss Spark Dev at [community.spark.io](https://community.spark.io/).
   * The [Spark Dev repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/spark-dev). This is where all
     core code resides.

4. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the command palette
   (`ctrl-shift-P`) and search for `Welcome`.
